The run_analysis script does the following

1. Loading the data into the variables
	
	'features' variable holds the contents of features.txt
		Dimensions : 561 x 2
		The features selected comes from accelerometer and gyroscope data
	
	activities <- activity_labels.txt
		Dimensions : 6 x 2
		List of activities performed when the corresponding measurements were taken and its 
		codes (labels)
		
	subject_test <- test/subject_test.txt 
		Dimensions : 2947 x 1 
		contains test data of 9/30 volunteer test subjects being observed

	x_test <- test/X_test.txt
		Dimensions : 2947 rows, 561 columns 
		contains recorded features test data

	y_test <- test/y_test.txt
		Dimensions : 2947 x 1 
		contains test data of activities’code labels

	subject_train <- test/subject_train.txt 
		Dimensions : 7352 rows, 1 column 
		contains train data of 21/30 volunteer subjects being observed

	x_train <- test/X_train.txt 
		Dimensions : 7352 rows, 561 columns 
		contains recorded features train data

	y_train <- test/y_train.txt
		Dimensions : 7352 rows, 1 columns 
		contains train data of activities’code labels 

2. Merging the datsets
	
	X 
		Dimensions : 10299 x 561
		X is created by merging x_train and x_test using rbind() 
	
	Y
		Dimension : 10299 x 1
		Y is created by merging y_train and y_test using rbind()
	
	Subject 
		Dimension : 10299x1
		Subject is created by merging subject_train and subject_test

	Merged_Data
		Dimension : 10299x563
		Merged_Data is created by merging Subject, Y and X using cbind()

3. Extracting only the means and standard deviations
	
	TidyData 
		Dimensions : 10299 x 88
		This is created by selecting only columns: subject, code and the measurements on 
		the mean and standard deviation (std) for each measurement from the MergedData

4. The names for variables are intuitive ones and doesn't produce any ambiguity. 

5. The labels in the data set are
	
	code column in TidyData renamed into activities
	Acc in column’s name replaced by Accelerometer
	Gyro in column’s name replaced by Gyroscope
	BodyBody in column’s name replaced by Body
	Mag in column’s name replaced by Magnitude
	All variables that start with character f in column’s name replaced by Frequency
	All variables that start with character t in column’s name replaced by Time

6. Final touches
	
	FinalData
		Dimensions : 180 x 88
		This is created by summarising TidyData by taking the means of each variable for 
		each activity and each subject, after grouped by subject and activity

	FinalData.txt
		Export FinalData into a txt file.
